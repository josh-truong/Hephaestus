## File Structure
The bulk of our code can be found in ./Hephaestus/controllers/grocery_shopper/behaviors. This folder contains a host of .py files which make up our controllers behavior tree, denotated with the suffix 'bt' in the file name. The behavior folder also contains a folder named models. Within models, one will find most of the other code.
